            <h2>About Linus Torvalds</h2>
            <p>
              Linus Benedict Torvalds is a Finnish-American software engineer
              who created the Linux kernel, which became the foundation for many
              operating systems, including the Linux operating system and
              Android. He is also the creator of Git, a distributed version
              control system widely used in software development.
